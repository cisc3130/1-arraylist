# ArrayList assignment

In ArrayListPractice.java, write code to

1. Declare an ArrayList of the correct type and size for what you want to put in it.
2. Add a bunch of elements to your list.
3. Add an element somewhere in the middle of your list.
4. Search for an element in your list and remove it. (Use the remove method that takes an index, not the one that takes an Object.)
5. Remove an element from the end of your list.

Make sure your code compiles! Code submitted with compilation errors will start with 50%.
